# Predictive_Maintenance_Model
## What is Predictive Maintenance?
Predictive maintenance is a technique that uses data analysis tools and techniques to detect anomalies in your operation and possible defects in equipment and processes so you can fix them before they result in failure.

## Why Predictive Maintenance?
Predictive Maintenance can help companies minimize downtime, reduce repair cost, and improve operational effeciency, Developing a web app for preditcive maintenance can provide user with real time insights into equipment performance, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing unplanned downtime.

## Functional Requirements
Users can provide process parameters to the model like Process Temperature, Rotational speed, Torque etc. and then user can receive a prediction whether the machine will fail or not, and also the type of failure.
Users can view and infer the performance measures of different machine learning models used.
Users can gain insights from the data graphs into behaviour of the equipment.
